       "\n",
       "1. **Identify the Relevant Section**: The context provides a table with summary statistics for various variables. We need to locate the section that pertains to the LinkedIn matched sample.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Locate the 'Data Science' Variable**: Within the table, find the row labeled 'Data Science'. This row will contain the mean value for the 'Data Science' variable in both the Coursera Internal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Extract the Mean Value for LinkedIn Matched Sample**: Once the 'Data Science' row is located, extract the mean value specifically for the LinkedIn matched sample.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's proceed with these steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "- The context provides a table with two columns of mean values: one for Coursera Internal Data and another for LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n",

The first mean value (0.236) corresponds to the Coursera Internal Data, and the second mean value (0.300) corresponds to the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n",

       "Therefore, the mean value for the 'Data Science' variable in the LinkedIn matched sample is 0.300.\n",
