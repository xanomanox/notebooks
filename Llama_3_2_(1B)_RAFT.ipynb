    "# Retrieval Augmented Finetuning (RAFT) Cookbook Recipe!\n",
    "This cookbook aims to show how to use Unsloth to use retrieval augmented finetuning (RAFT). Supervised finetuning is like a closed-book examination where we encode knowledge from the training dataset into the LLM during finetuning, and then test it on unseen examples in the \"exam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "RAFT differs from this in that it is an open-book exam format of finetuning! We allow the LLM to see not just the question and answer (in chain-of-thought format), but also the contexts. The hope is that the LLM will be able to acquire the domain knowledge, but also an improved ability to synthesize answers from context.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Identify the Relevant Section**: The context provides a table with summary statistics for various variables. We need to locate the section that pertains to the LinkedIn matched sample.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Locate the 'Data Science' Variable**: Within the table, find the row labeled 'Data Science'. This row will contain the mean value for the 'Data Science' variable in both the Coursera Internal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Extract the Mean Value for LinkedIn Matched Sample**: Once the 'Data Science' row is located, extract the mean value specifically for the LinkedIn matched sample.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's proceed with these steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "- The context provides a table with two columns of mean values: one for Coursera Internal Data and another for LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n",
       "\n",
       "- ##begin_quote## Data Science 0.236 0.001 0.300 0.002 ##end_quote##: This line from the context shows the mean values for the 'Data Science' variable.
