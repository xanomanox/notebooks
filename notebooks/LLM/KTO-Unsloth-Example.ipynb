    "The goal of [Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) alignment](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01306.pdf) is to directly maximize the utility of language model generations by incorporating human psychological biases into the optimization process. KTO aims to create language models that are better aligned with human values, needs, and decision-making processes without relying on preference data. It achieves this by using a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable, making it easier and more cost-effective to align models at scale compared to methods that require preference pairs."

But [that] will be later.\"\\n\\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions\u2026And we especially need air defense systems.\"\\n\\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine\\'s top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\\n\\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\\n\\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won\\'t be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America\\'s \"global leadership.\"\\n\\nHe further emphasized Zelensky\\'s continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it\\'s purely on Kiev\\'s terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\\n\\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:\\n</document>\\n\\n<category>\\nURW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless\\n</category><end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n',\n",

      "\n",
      " Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a \u201cglobal coalition of mayors\u201d at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a press release, Garcetti\u2019s office said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mayor Eric Garcetti this week attended the C40 World Mayors Summit \u2013 joining mayors, climate experts, youth activists, and business leaders from around the world to advance global action to combat the climate crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is an international network of nearly 100 of the world\u2019s largest cities committed to concrete action to combat climate change. Mayor Garcetti served as Chair of C40 from 2019 to 2021, and was succeeded by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to fighting the climate crisis, our commitments as cities, states, and countries are only as strong as the size and ambition of our global coalition,\u201d said Mayor Eric Garcetti. \u201cThe C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action \u2013 it\u2019s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people\u2019s daily lives. It\u2019s also an opportunity to help national governments better understand the steps we can take together to chart a path toward a more livable and prosperous future.\u201d\n",
      "\n",
      "Garcetti joined a U.S. Department of Transportation presentation on \u201chigh-quality urban transportation infrastructure,\u201d though L.A.\u2019s infrastructure is not widely considered \u201chigh-quality.\u201d A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended because of a potential landslide hazard.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his opening address to the climate summit, according to the mayor\u2019s office, he \u201claid out how Los Angeles is transitioning to clean energy sources and delivering on our climate justice commitments.\u201d Garcetti\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.\n",
      "\n",
      "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti\u2019s party.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator, Garcetti\u2019s trip would have burned 1275.6 kg of carbon if he flew economy class, and twice as much if he flew business or \u201cpremium\u201d class (assuming a stop in Atlanta). That is one-fourth (economy) or one-half (premium) the global average per capita use of carbon per year. It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.\n",
